OpenBills
===

An API for accessing customer billing and usage information across a range of public utility companies.


What is it?
---
OpenBills is a public, free and openly licensed API that provides developers and their end users, a secure and reliable method of acessing billing and usage data from a range of utility service providers (eg: electricity, gas, water services, etc.) whose customers' accounts and personal information is made available for personal use, and accessible either as HTML, downloadable files, or via an existing provider-specific API.

OpenBills aims to provide a wide coverage of utility services by employing web-scraping techniques submitted by an active community of deveopers, civic hackers, and end-users who demand open bills just like those of the Asian Openbill stork home to the Indian subcontinent and Southeast Asia.
